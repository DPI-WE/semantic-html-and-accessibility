# Semantic HTML and Accessibility ðŸ‘“

## Introduction to Semantic HTML
Semantic HTML is a coding style where the HTML tags convey the meaning of the content. By using semantic tags, we can make our web pages more understandable to both humans and machines, including search engines and assistive technologies.

## Benefits of Semantic HTML
- **Improved Accessibility**: Screen readers and other assistive technologies can better interpret the content.
- **Enhanced SEO**: Search engines can better understand and index the content.
- **Better Maintainability**: Clear structure and meaning make the code easier to read and maintain.
- **Consistent Styling**: Browsers apply default styles to semantic elements, which can save time in styling.

## Common Semantic HTML Tags
Here are some of the most common semantic HTML tags and their uses:

### Structural Tags
- `<header>`: Defines a header for a document or a section.
- `<nav>`: Defines a container for navigation links.
- `<main>`: Specifies the main content of a document.
- `<section>`: Defines a section in a document.
- `<article>`: Represents a self-contained piece of content.
- `<aside>`: Defines content aside from the main content (e.g., sidebar).
- `<footer>`: Defines a footer for a document or a section.

### Text Content Tags
- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Define headings, `<h1>` being the highest level and `<h6>` the lowest.
- `<p>`: Defines a paragraph.
- `<blockquote>`: Defines a block of quoted text.
- `<cite>`: Defines the title of a work.
- `<code>`: Defines a block of code.
Media Tags
- `<figure>`: Specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.
- `<figcaption>`: Provides a caption for the `<figure>` element.
- `<audio>`: Defines sound content.
- `<video>`: Defines video content.

## Introduction to Accessibility
Accessibility refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people who experience disabilities. In web development, this means making your website usable for as many people as possible.

## Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are a set of guidelines developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to make web content more accessible. The guidelines are organized around four principles, often remembered by the acronym POUR:

- **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
- **Operable**: User interface components and navigation must be operable.
- **Understandable**: Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
- **Robust**: Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

## Key Accessibility Practices
- **Use Semantic HTML Tags**: Helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the structure and content of your web pages.
- **Provide Text Alternatives for Non-Text Content**: Use alt attributes for images, and provide transcripts for audio and video content.
- **Ensure Sufficient Color Contrast**: Make sure text is readable against its background.
- **Enable Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure that all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard.
- **Use ARIA Landmarks and Roles**: ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) helps to improve accessibility of dynamic content.

## Example of Semantic HTML with Accessibility

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Accessible Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>My Accessible Website</h1>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
  <main>
    <section id="home">
      <h2>Welcome to My Website</h2>
      <p>This is an example of a web page using semantic HTML and accessibility features.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="about">
      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
